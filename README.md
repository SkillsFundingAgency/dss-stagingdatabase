# DSS Database (incl. PowerBI)

The repo contains:
- Database changes for DSS, mostly used by PowerBI reporting
- SQL stored procedures which are associated with DSS tables 
- Procedures to import data from Azure CosmosDB
- PowerBI reporting related scripts
- Table and View scripts

Once deployed this code is not made available via an API, so it is therefore **not** versioned.
